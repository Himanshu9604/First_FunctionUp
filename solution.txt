git stash apply applies the changes from the most recent stash to your working directory, but leaves the stash itself intact. This means that you can apply the same stash multiple times, or apply different stashes in any order you like.

git stash pop also applies the changes from the most recent stash to your working directory, but it removes the stash from the list of stashes. This means that you can only apply a stash once with git stash pop.[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[Ai[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B
